# Performance-Evaluation-of-IntrusionDetectionSystems-Using-MachineLearning-Techniques-In-ApacheSpark
Dec 2018 – Mar 2019

In recent times, in the context of network communications, network intrusion has become a major problem. To overcome this intrusion many intrusion detection systems have been developed aiming to identify unauthorized access and malicious attacks in the network environment. Among them Machine Learning is one of the efficient analysis framework to detect threats in the network traffic flow. Our project evaluates the performance of Intrusion detection system based on Logistic regression ,Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms of Machine Learning using Apache Spark, a big data processing tool .UNSW-NB15,a recently updated dataset is used to carry out the evaluation. The overall performance is evaluated in terms of detection accuracy ,building time(or) training time and prediction time.
